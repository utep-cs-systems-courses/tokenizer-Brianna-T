Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

My Tokenizer:

Firstly, any files labeled "lab", if they are accidently pushed into Github,
is for notes taken for lectures in person from lab.

To start, my code is created in "tokenizer.c" to follow the instructions of
the methods' names made in "tokenizer.h".
